The architecture balances monumentality with intimacy, offering contemplative courtyards and fluid exhibition spaces."

  text: "The design process began with capturing Córdoba’s unique light quality and historic context. Through iterative sketches and massing models, the museum's volumes were positioned to frame views, optimize daylight, and create shifting experiences of shadow and transparency. Materials were chosen to age gracefully and interact with the sun, enhancing the sensory journey."

reflection: "Museo de la Luz taught us that architecture can choreograph light itself. By embracing transparency and shadow, the building becomes a lens through which the ephemeral beauty of daylight is captured, offering moments of reflection and serenity."
