title: "Jardines de Luz"
subtitle: "Cultural Center • Medellín, Colombia • 2024"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a modern cultural center nestled within lush urban gardens, expansive glass façades reflecting morning light, terraced green roofs, warm timber accents, soft mist enveloping the scene, cinematic composition"
description: "Jardines de Luz emerges as a sanctuary of culture amidst Medellín’s dense urban fabric. The design blurs interior and exterior boundaries, allowing natural light and verdant landscapes to permeate every space. Curved volumes and transparent materials evoke openness, fostering community gatherings and contemplative solitude alike."

  images:
    - { src: "Hand-drawn conceptual sketches on textured paper, fluid organic forms, ink and pencil lines suggesting garden integration and curvilinear volumes", caption: "Initial concept sketches" }
    - { src: "Material board featuring warm timber panels, polished concrete samples, green roof textures, and reflective glass swatches, beautifully arranged", caption: "Material exploration" }
    - { src: "Site analysis diagram showing sun path over urban blocks, wind flow arrows, topography lines, schematic overlay of building footprint and landscape zones", caption: "Site analysis and solar studies" }
    - { src: "Volumetric massing study with 3D foam core and translucent layers, aerial perspective highlighting interaction of terraces and public spaces", caption: "Volumetric studies" }
  text: "The design process unfolded through an intimate reading of the urban context and the interplay of light, vegetation, and circulation. Early sketches explored organic forms, evolving into layered terraces that weave gardens with gathering spaces, while material palettes were refined to balance warmth and transparency."

  - { src: "Close-up texture: polished concrete and timber interface in interior gallery, high-resolution render", caption: "Interior material detail" }
  - { src: "Architectural plan: ground floor layout with circulation paths and garden zones, monochrome linework", caption: "Ground floor plan" }

reflection: "In Jardines de Luz, we learned that architecture can be a gentle mediator between nature and community. Light, greenery, and material honesty coalesce, transforming a cultural center into a living, breathing organism that nurtures both creativity and serenity."
