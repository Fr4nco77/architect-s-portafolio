description: "The Biblioteca del Río was envisioned as a threshold between the flowing waters and the quiet of knowledge. Its architecture celebrates transparency and rhythm: a structure of timber and glass that breathes with the river breeze, while its interiors weave intimacy and openness. The design aims to craft a civic refuge where light, silence, and reflection coexist harmoniously."

  text: "The design emerged from a careful reading of the riverfront context. Iterative studies tested how the library could float lightly on its site without obstructing views of the Paraná. Timber was chosen for its warmth and sustainability, while transparency was embraced to allow both city and river to permeate the spaces. Each decision sought balance between monumentality and quiet humility."

reflection: "This project taught us the value of listening—to water, to wind, to silence. By letting the river guide the architecture, we discovered that a library can be both shelter and horizon, both vessel of memory and place of pause. The Biblioteca del Río became not only a home for books, but a dialogue between nature and culture, between permanence and flow."
