title: "Whispering Library of the Dunes"
subtitle: "Cultural • Essaouira, Morocco • 2024"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a low-slung library emerging from desert dunes, curvilinear walls of rammed earth, latticed cedar screens filtering sunlight, terraces adorned with succulents, golden hour lighting, cinematic atmosphere, soft shadows on sand"
description: "This library is conceived as a dialogue with the desert winds and the whisper of the Atlantic beyond the horizon. Spaces flow organically, inviting quiet contemplation while the architecture itself becomes a mediator between knowledge, light, and the tactile beauty of natural materials."

    - { src: "Hand-drawn sketches on kraft paper showing sweeping rammed earth walls, organic forms, pencil and ink, atmospheric studio lighting", caption: "Initial concept sketches" }
    - { src: "Material exploration board featuring rammed earth, local cedar, woven textiles, ochre pigments, photographed in soft daylight", caption: "Material exploration" }
    - { src: "Site analysis diagrams with sand dune contours, prevailing wind directions, sun path studies, ink and watercolor style", caption: "Site analysis and solar studies" }
    - { src: "Volumetric massing models in white foam core and translucent acrylic, shadows and light play under warm studio light", caption: "Volumetric studies" }
  text: "The design process began by tracing the dune patterns, studying how light and wind could be harnessed to animate interiors. Iterative models refined the organic curvatures, creating a gentle hierarchy of reading spaces and communal terraces that respond to both climate and poetic aspiration."

reflection: "Through shaping this library, we learned that architecture can breathe with the landscape. Here, silence becomes tangible, and knowledge feels like a wind that meanders through spaces, leaving traces of light and memory."
