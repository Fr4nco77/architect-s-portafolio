description: "This library is conceived as a dialogue with the desert winds and the whisper of the Atlantic beyond the horizon. Spaces flow organically, inviting quiet contemplation while the architecture itself becomes a mediator between knowledge, light, and the tactile beauty of natural materials."

  text: "The design process began by tracing the dune patterns, studying how light and wind could be harnessed to animate interiors. Iterative models refined the organic curvatures, creating a gentle hierarchy of reading spaces and communal terraces that respond to both climate and poetic aspiration."
