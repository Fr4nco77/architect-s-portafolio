description: "Centro Botánico Aurora seeks to harmonize scientific inquiry with the poetic rhythms of nature. Its architecture celebrates transparency and connectivity, allowing researchers and visitors to traverse spaces that blur boundaries between interior and exterior, laboratory and garden, observation and immersion."

  text: "The design evolved through iterative models that responded to the sloping site and dense vegetation. Bridges and terraces were positioned to maximize light and airflow, while minimizing ecological impact. Material choices and pavilion orientation were guided by durability, transparency, and the desire to seamlessly integrate with the natural landscape."

reflection: "Designing Aurora reminded us that architecture can be an extension of the landscape, not an intrusion. By weaving paths and pavilions through greenery, the project revealed the poetry in coexistence—science and nature, structure and serenity."
