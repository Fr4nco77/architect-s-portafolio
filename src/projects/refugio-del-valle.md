title: "Refugio del Valle"
subtitle: "Hospitality • Mendoza, Argentina • 2025"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a modern mountain lodge perched on a hillside, with expansive floor-to-ceiling glass walls, warm timber cladding, stone base integrated with the slope, panoramic views of the Andes at sunrise, soft mist around the valley, cinematic lighting"
description: "Refugio del Valle is conceived as a sanctuary nestled within the rugged beauty of the Andes. The architecture seeks to merge seamlessly with the landscape, using natural materials and panoramic glazing to connect guests with the surrounding mountains. Interior spaces flow organically, offering moments of introspection and communal warmth."

    - { src: "Hand-drawn sketches on tracing paper showing lodge volumes, terraces, and circulation paths, pencil and ink, emphasizing integration with slope", caption: "Initial concept sketches" }
    - { src: "Material exploration board featuring local stone, warm timber planks, textured wool textiles, natural fiber fabrics, arranged on studio table with lighting tests", caption: "Material exploration" }
    - { src: "Site analysis diagrams: slope mapping, sun path, prevailing winds, vegetation zones, annotated with arrows and contour lines, architectural diagram style", caption: "Site analysis and solar studies" }
    - { src: "Volumetric study with 3D foam models showing massing, overhangs, terraces, and shadow play under directional lighting", caption: "Volumetric studies" }
  text: "The design process began by studying the steep topography and microclimates of the site. Early sketches explored terracing and roof slopes that respond to the Andes’ dramatic angles. Iterative models refined the balance between solid stone bases and transparent upper volumes, while careful material selection reinforced a sense of warmth and belonging."

reflection: "Designing Refugio del Valle taught that architecture’s greatest gift is presence. By listening to the landscape, allowing light and stone to guide form, the lodge became more than a building—it became a quiet companion to the mountains, offering shelter without intruding."
