description: "Refugio del Valle is conceived as a sanctuary nestled within the rugged beauty of the Andes. The architecture seeks to merge seamlessly with the landscape, using natural materials and panoramic glazing to connect guests with the surrounding mountains. Interior spaces flow organically, offering moments of introspection and communal warmth."

  text: "The design process began by studying the steep topography and microclimates of the site. Early sketches explored terracing and roof slopes that respond to the Andes’ dramatic angles. Iterative models refined the balance between solid stone bases and transparent upper volumes, while careful material selection reinforced a sense of warmth and belonging."

reflection: "Designing Refugio del Valle taught that architecture’s greatest gift is presence. By listening to the landscape, allowing light and stone to guide form, the lodge became more than a building—it became a quiet companion to the mountains, offering shelter without intruding."
