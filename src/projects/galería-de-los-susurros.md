title: "Galería de los Susurros"
subtitle: "Cultural • Valparaíso, Chile • 2024"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a contemporary hillside art gallery cascading along steep terraced terrain, corten steel and glass volumes reflecting ocean light, green roof terraces with native vegetation, warm late afternoon sunlight, cinematic shadows, moody atmospheric fog in the distance"
description: "Galería de los Susurros emerges as a dialogue between Valparaíso’s rugged topography and its vibrant artistic pulse. The design weaves public and private spaces across the hillside, celebrating the city’s verticality while inviting the visitor into moments of contemplation framed by light, texture, and view corridors."

  images:
    - { src: "Hand-drawn conceptual sketches of cascading gallery volumes along steep terrain, pencil and ink lines, annotations showing spatial flow", caption: "Initial concept sketches" }
    - { src: "Material board showing corten steel panels, timber accents, glass curtain walls, and stone, photographed on architectural studio table", caption: "Material exploration" }
    - { src: "Site analysis diagram: topography, solar orientation, ocean wind patterns, pedestrian circulation, diagrammatic style", caption: "Site analysis and solar studies" }
    - { src: "White foam core volumetric massing models of the gallery, casting soft shadows under studio lighting, exploring terraced forms", caption: "Volumetric studies" }
  text: "The design process began with mapping the complex slope and sun paths, iterating sketches that respect both the natural topography and urban fabric. Each terrace was studied to balance exhibition space, visitor circulation, and outdoor connectivity, culminating in a rhythm of volumes that cascade gently down the hillside."

  - { src: "High-resolution render: corten steel wall texture, showing weathering patterns and material depth", caption: "Corten steel texture" }
  - { src: "Ground floor plan, monochrome vector drawing, indicating exhibition spaces and circulation", caption: "Ground floor plan" }
  - { src: "Longitudinal section cutting through gallery terraces, showing interior-exterior relationship", caption: "Longitudinal section" }
  - { src: "Exploded axonometric of window assembly: aluminum frame, double glazing, sun shading elements", caption: "Window assembly detail" }
  - { src: "Detail of floating timber stair between terraces, photorealistic lighting and material finish", caption: "Floating stair detail" }
reflection: "In tracing the contours of the hillside, we learned to let the landscape guide the architecture. The gallery does not impose—it whispers, embracing movement, light, and the ephemeral dialogue between stone, steel, and sea."
