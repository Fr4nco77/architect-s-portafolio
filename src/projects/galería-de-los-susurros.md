description: "Galería de los Susurros emerges as a dialogue between Valparaíso’s rugged topography and its vibrant artistic pulse. The design weaves public and private spaces across the hillside, celebrating the city’s verticality while inviting the visitor into moments of contemplation framed by light, texture, and view corridors."

  text: "The design process began with mapping the complex slope and sun paths, iterating sketches that respect both the natural topography and urban fabric. Each terrace was studied to balance exhibition space, visitor circulation, and outdoor connectivity, culminating in a rhythm of volumes that cascade gently down the hillside."

reflection: "In tracing the contours of the hillside, we learned to let the landscape guide the architecture. The gallery does not impose—it whispers, embracing movement, light, and the ephemeral dialogue between stone, steel, and sea."
