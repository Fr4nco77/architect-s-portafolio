title: "Biblioteca de los Vientos"
subtitle: "Cultural • Valparaíso, Chile • 2024"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a contemporary hillside library perched on Valparaíso's cliffs, terraced concrete and timber volumes cascading with the slope, large glass façades reflecting the Pacific Ocean, warm afternoon light, lush greenery integrated into terraces, cinematic shadows, atmospheric perspective"
description: "Conceived as a sanctuary for thought and contemplation, the library engages with the winds and vistas of Valparaíso. Its cascading terraces and open reading spaces blur the boundary between interior and exterior, inviting visitors to wander, linger, and absorb the interplay of light, ocean, and text. Material honesty and fluid circulation shape the poetic rhythm of the spaces."

  images:
    - { src: "Sketchbook page with freehand pencil and ink drawings of cascading library volumes, exploratory perspectives, conceptual lines emphasizing slope and terraces", caption: "Initial concept sketches" }
    - { src: "Material board featuring warm timber planks, board-formed concrete samples, glass textures, local stone fragments, arranged aesthetically on a studio table", caption: "Material exploration" }
    - { src: "Site analysis diagram showing cliff topography, wind patterns, solar path, arrows indicating views and circulation, hand-drawn overlay on aerial map", caption: "Site analysis and solar studies" }
    - { src: "Volumetric massing study of the library in white foam core, multiple cascading blocks, sunlight casting dynamic shadows, studio lighting photography", caption: "Volumetric studies" }
  text: "The design process began by embracing the steep terrain, analyzing wind, sun, and view corridors. Initial sketches explored the terraced form, creating public and private reading zones. Material studies reinforced a tactile palette that balances the rawness of concrete with the warmth of timber. Iterative volumetric models refined the interplay between solid and void, framing panoramas without overpowering the cliffside context."

reflection: "Through this project, we learned that architecture can be a gentle guide rather than a dominator. By listening to the winds, embracing the slope, and framing the horizon, the library became a dialogue between place, material, and human curiosity—a space where thought flows as freely as the Pacific breeze."
