subtitle: "Cultural • Valparaíso, Chile • 2024"

description: "Conceived as a sanctuary for thought and contemplation, the library engages with the winds and vistas of Valparaíso. Its cascading terraces and open reading spaces blur the boundary between interior and exterior, inviting visitors to wander, linger, and absorb the interplay of light, ocean, and text. Material honesty and fluid circulation shape the poetic rhythm of the spaces."

  text: "The design process began by embracing the steep terrain, analyzing wind, sun, and view corridors. Initial sketches explored the terraced form, creating public and private reading zones. Material studies reinforced a tactile palette that balances the rawness of concrete with the warmth of timber. Iterative volumetric models refined the interplay between solid and void, framing panoramas without overpowering the cliffside context."

reflection: "Through this project, we learned that architecture can be a gentle guide rather than a dominator. By listening to the winds, embracing the slope, and framing the horizon, the library became a dialogue between place, material, and human curiosity—a space where thought flows as freely as the Pacific breeze."
