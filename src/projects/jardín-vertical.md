title: "Jardín Vertical"
subtitle: "Cultural Pavilion • Medellín, Colombia • 2021"
hero: "Photorealistic render of a contemporary cultural pavilion draped in vertical gardens, exposed bamboo structure, translucent polycarbonate panels glowing with warm interior light, lush vegetation cascading over terraces, twilight atmosphere with soft lantern-like glow"
description: "Conceived as a living threshold between city and forest, the pavilion becomes both garden and gathering space. Its architecture celebrates biophilia, weaving natural growth into structural clarity. Light and air move freely through porous walls, transforming the building into an urban breathing organism."

  text: "The design emerged from the tension between structure and growth. Bamboo was chosen for its ecological resilience and cultural resonance, while the vertical gardens softened the tectonic frame. Iterations tested how light filtered through polycarbonate layers, how plants thrived at different heights, and how circulation wrapped itself around courtyards of vegetation."

reflection: "This pavilion whispered the lesson that architecture can be a caretaker. By relinquishing control and letting growth take hold, the building transformed beyond authorship—into a landscape, a habitat, a breathing partner with the city."
